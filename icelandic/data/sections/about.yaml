# a summary about you
summary: 'For many of us, learning the words gets us only part of the way. Using them by communicating with others, practising that pronunciation and listening to each other takes us the rest of the way. Hopefully, having some fun while at it. The group lessons are aimed to build a support net, where you can share with others the frustrations of learning a new language, as well as the joys. If you prefer private tutoring, private lessons are available. They are based on the same ideology of having fun learning with your tutor.'
